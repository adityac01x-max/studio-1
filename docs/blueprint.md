## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saffron (#FF9933), representing the vibrancy and spirituality of India. This warm, inviting color can be used for primary buttons and highlights.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), offering a neutral and clean backdrop to ensure content and visuals stand out.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), providing a contrasting, complementary color for secondary actions, links, and interactive elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a versatile, legible, humanist sans-serif font suitable for user interface elements, short paragraphs and general information display.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', an elegant modern sans-serif typeface with geometric qualities and a high-end feel; this will provide contrast and catch the user's attention when needed, in concert with PT Sans.
- Use clear and intuitive icons sourced from Material Design to ensure clarity and accessibility. Icons will relate to travel, locations, weather, and other pertinent categories.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations for a smooth and engaging user experience, without distracting from the app's functionality. Page transitions will fade, controls will 'bounce,' and loading animations will loop gently.
